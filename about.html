                <p>Austin Richard Post (born July 4, 1995), known professionally as Post Malone, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer. Known for his introspective songwriting and laconic vocal style, Malone has gained acclaim for blending a range of genres including hip hop, pop, R&B, and trap. He initially garnered recognition in 2015 following the release of his debut single "White Iverson." Post Malone was born in Syracuse, New York. When he was nine years old, he moved with his family to Grapevine, Texas, after his father became the manager of concessions for the Dallas Cowboys. He began playing the guitar and auditioned for the band Crown the Empire in 2010, but was rejected after his guitar strings broke during the audition. He credited his initial interest in learning guitar to the video game *Guitar Hero*. According to Malone, he chose 'Post Malone' as his stage name when he was around 14 or 15. He reportedly used a rap name generator. </p><p>Before achieving mainstream success, Malone worked at Chicken Express to earn money. He enrolled at Tarrant County College, but dropped out to pursue a music career, moving to Los Angeles with his friend Jason Probst. After moving to L.A., Malone, Probst, and several other producers and artists formed the music group BLCKVRD. In 2015, he released "White Iverson," which went viral and gained him widespread attention. The song led to him signing a record deal with Republic Records. His debut studio album, *Stoney*, was released in 2016 and featured the hit singles "Congratulations" featuring Quavo and "I Fall Apart." *Stoney* eventually achieved multi-platinum certification from the RIAA. </p><p>Post Malone's second album, *Beerbongs & Bentleys*, released in 2018, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and broke several streaming records. It spawned the hit singles "Rockstar" featuring 21 Savage, "Psycho" featuring Ty Dolla $ign, and "Better Now." *Hollywood's Bleeding*, his third studio album, followed in 2019 and also debuted at number one. This album included the hit singles "Wow.", "Goodbyes" featuring Young Thug, and "Circles." In 2022, he released his fourth studio album, *Twelve Carat Toothache*, featuring collaborations with Doja Cat, Roddy Ricch, Gunna, and The Weeknd. Post Malone's fifth studio album, *Austin*, released in 2023, marked a departure towards a more live-instrument focused sound, with him playing guitar on every track. </p><p>Malone is known for his genre-bending musical style, which incorporates elements of hip hop, pop, trap, rock, and country. His introspective lyrics often deal with themes of heartbreak, fame, and excess. He is also known for his distinctive fashion sense, which includes face tattoos and a penchant for cowboy hats. Throughout his career, Post Malone has received numerous accolades, including multiple American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, and MTV Video Music Awards. He has been nominated for several Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year for *Beerbongs & Bentleys* and *Hollywood's Bleeding*. He continues to be a prominent figure in the music industry, consistently pushing boundaries and connecting with audiences through his unique sound and relatable lyrics.</p>
